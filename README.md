# artstack
Generative art library, with a focus on reproducibility and variation

# Install

# Overview
Traditionally, generative art frameworks like Processing work as bespoke pieces, with one script resulting in one piece.  If you generate a piece you like and want to make variations, you need to create a whole seperate script for it.  

Artstack changes this, by viewing each change as a layer within a piece. By using these layers, it allows for rapid iteration, as each layer can be slotted in at any point. In addition, parameters can be randomized, allowing for multiple different variations to be created on each run.  Since each layer's parameters are modifiable, each program run is capable of multiple mutations on multiple layers.
